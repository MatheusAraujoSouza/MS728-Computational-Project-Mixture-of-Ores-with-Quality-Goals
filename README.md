# MS728-Computational-Project-Mixture-of-Ores-with-Quality-Goals
The problem presented consists of a mining company that receives an order to produce 6000 tons of ore that needs to meet certain specifications.
These specifications dictate the priority of the use of ore, the ideal content (in percentage) of the use of the ores, the minimum and maximum content for each material.
For this work, we adopted the use of 5 ores that will be our parameters: iron (Fe), aluminum oxide (AL203), phosphorus (P), polypropylene carbonate (PPC) and helium (He)
